The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.15.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release contains updates to the Afrikaans, Malayalam, Malay,
Israeli, classical English and Portuguese tables. It also contains a new
table for Coptic thanks to first-time contributor Ibraam Nasif. Behind
the scenes there have been major changes to the cross-compilation
tool-chain that will finally allow us to ship pre-built windows binaries
that contain ``lou_checkyaml.exe``.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

Invisible changes
-----------------

-  Major rework of the cross-compilation tool-chain. There are now
   Docker images that should allow for local builds of binaries for 32
   and 64 bit. These include the libyaml library so the binaries contain
   ``lou_checkyaml.exe``. This will allow table creators to test their
   changes locally under windows.
