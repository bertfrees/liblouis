# Tests for #507: mixed lower and upper case.

# we define a very simple table and just test whether the word rule
# matches when we encounter mixed case input. Since we do not define
# any caps rules we expect liblouis to ignore capitalization
table: |
  uplow Ii 24
  uplow Mm 134
  uplow Tt  2345
  word mit 2345

tests:
  - [mit, t]
  - [Mit, t]
  - [MIT, t]
  - [mIt, t]
  - [miT, t]

# same test as above basically but this time using an always rule
# instead of a word rule
table: |
  uplow Ii 24
  uplow Mm 134
  uplow Tt  2345
  always mit 2345

tests:
  - [mit, t]
  - [Mit, t]
  - [MIT, t]
  - [mIt, t]
  - [miT, t]

# here's another test similar to the first one just using a different
# input text
table: |
  uplow Aa 1
  uplow Mm 134
  uplow Nn  1345
  word man 134

tests:
  - [man, m]
  - [Man, m]
  - [MAN, m]
  - [maN, m]
  - [mAn, m]

# when enabling capitalization using a capsletter rule everything
# works as expected
table: |
  uplow Ii 24
  uplow Mm 134
  uplow Tt  2345
  always mit 2345
  sign $ 46
  capsletter 46

tests:
  - [mit, t]
  - [Mit, $t]
  - [MIT, t]
  - [mIt, m$it]
  - [miT, mi$t]
